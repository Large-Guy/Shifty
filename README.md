*The ultimate, minimalist browsing experience.*

## About

Shifty works through a **single shortcut**,
> **double-shift** → opens the **command palette**

From the palette you can run any command you'd expect in a
modern browser (and more!) in just a few keystrokes.

Shifty has **zero native ui** besides a lightweight command palette,
to keep your experience as distraction free as possible.
